Implement a platform with 2 endpoints like [TinyUrl](https://tinyurl.com/app)
[POST]{url,[alias]}
[GET]{tiny_url} => 302 url

There are so many aspects that can be covered here:

Grow your solution from 2 Minimal Api endpoints in a Program.cs storing in SQL iterating to

- Separate Write/Read Apis
- Caching with expiration (high likely new urls will be hit often than older ones)
- NoSQL
- Analytics
- Rate limiting
- URL store sharding

Happy coding!
